# NumbersACH

Identifying information for transferring money to or from a US account via ACH or wire transfer.

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**account_id** | **str** | The Plaid account ID associated with the account numbers | 
**account** | **str** | The ACH account number for the account.  Note that when using OAuth with Chase Bank (&#x60;ins_56&#x60;), Chase will issue \&quot;tokenized\&quot; routing and account numbers, which are not the user&#39;s actual account and routing numbers. These tokenized numbers should work identically to normal account and routing numbers. The digits returned in the &#x60;mask&#x60; field will continue to reflect the actual account number, rather than the tokenized account number; for this reason, when displaying account numbers to the user to help them identify their account in your UI, always use the &#x60;mask&#x60; rather than truncating the &#x60;account&#x60; number. If a user revokes their permissions to your app, the tokenized numbers will continue to work for ACH deposits, but not withdrawals. | 
**routing** | **str** | The ACH routing number for the account. If the institution is &#x60;ins_56&#x60;, this may be a tokenized routing number. For more information, see the description of the &#x60;account&#x60; field. | 
**wire_routing** | **str, none_type** | The wire transfer routing number for the account, if available | 
**any string name** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | any string name can be used but the value must be the correct type | [optional]
